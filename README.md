# Ve Coin

VeCoin is a basic cryptocurrency blockchain implemented in TypeScript. It is designed for educational purposes to help users understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. This project provides a simplified version of a blockchain, focusing on the core principles and mechanisms without the complexities and security features of a production-ready system.

_⚠️ For education purposes only. This is by no means a complete implementation and it is by no means secure!_
